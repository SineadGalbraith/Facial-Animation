# Facial Animation

The objective of this assignment was to implement facial animation using blendshapes.

Each facial expression is saved internally as a delta-blendshape together with the neutral expression. Facial expressions are computed based on the neutral face, the delta-blendshapes and the blendshape weights. The blendshape weights can be controlled using the Anttweakbar within the program.

C/C++ and OpenGL have been used for this assignment.
